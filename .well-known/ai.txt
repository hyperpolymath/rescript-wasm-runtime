## Human vs. AI Contributions

This project welcomes both human and AI-assisted contributions:
- AI-generated code is allowed with human review
- All contributions must pass type checking and tests
- Humans are responsible for AI-generated code quality
- AI tools are assistants, not replacements for human judgment

## Transparency

This codebase was developed with assistance from:
- Claude (Anthropic) - Initial architecture and implementation
- Human developers - Review, testing, production deployment

We believe in transparent AI collaboration and require:
- Disclosure when AI significantly contributed
- Human review of all AI-generated code
- Testing and validation by humans
- Human accountability for final code
